 # Crop Recommendation using IBM AutoAI
This project is part of my IBM AICED Internship (Week 1).  
I used IBM Watson AutoAI to build a Machine Learning model that recommends the most suitable crop based on:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

The model was trained using IBM's AutoAI and tested with sample values.
